 * A circular region the operating system watches on the app's behalf.

 * Region monitoring is not the tracking API with a distance check bolted on: the
 * OS does the watching, wakes a *terminated* app to deliver the crossing, and
 * costs effectively no battery because it rides on hardware the device is
 * already using. That is why this exists separately from `startTracking` —
 * polling cannot see someone whose phone is in their pocket with the app closed,
 * which is the only situation this feature is for.
 *
 * Platform limits worth knowing before you design around it:
 * - iOS monitors at most 20 regions per app, and clamps a radius larger than the
 *   device's maximum (typically ~1-2 km). Android allows 100.
 * - Both platforms need "Allow all the time" location permission. With only
 *   "While Using", regions are registered but never fire once the app is
 *   backgrounded.
 * - Delivery is best-effort and can lag by a minute or more; the OS trades
 *   promptness for power. Treat a crossing as "they have arrived", never as a
 *   precise timestamp.
